1) I would like to say that there is a correlation to performance gain when it is less I/O intensive and more computation intensive. And it it holds true in the case of OIL1 and OIL6. The lower the time for I/O lead to more performance gain. For example, OIL6 in the sequential had 1111.818/358.586 overall execution time which led to 3.1x increase in performance. The I/O time for the sequential was 736.834 sec. while the I/O for the concurrent one was 151.435 sec. However, invert which was supposedly to technically be the fastest didnâ€™t get a higher increase(4.9X increase) in performance than smear(5.56x increase). 

2) The Concurrent times are way faster than the sequential version. This is because of the use of multiple cores to do more work at one time. In the Sequential version you was essentially doing all the work core which made it take more time doing one thing more that the other. The Concurrent one you could have someone reading in images while the other thread was writing to disk. If it was supposed to be longer, the only reason I could think of is that we are working with a queue of a fixed size and if the queue was full then we would have to wait and block, which would lead to more time.
